# Java Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java. It includes a basic user interface for game interaction and logic to control the snake's movement and game mechanics.

## Files Description
- `Main.java`: The main class that runs the game.
- `Menu.java`: Handles the game menu and user interactions.
- `SnakeGame.java`: Contains the game's logic, mechanics, and UI rendering.

## How to Run
To play the game, compile and run the `Main.java` file. Make sure that all three files are in the same directory.

## Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Try to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's body.

Enjoy the game!
